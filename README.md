A wrist rest that looks great next to your mechanical keyboard! Add some personality to your battle station by printing this in your favorite colors!

The wrist rest is broken up into multiple sections with a chevron design. This allows you to print interesting color combinations and also means you can print this wrist rest on smaller printers – I printed mine on a MINI!

It's perfectly sized for my 87 key WASD, and should fit many othermechanical (or normal) keyboards well. I've also provided STL files with different length for 61 keys and 104 keys. If this doesn't meet your needs, you can customize the parameters in OpenSCAD.

## Printing Tips

 - After importing the STL, use “Split to objects” so you can rearrange the pieces for your printer. For small printers delete the pieces that don't fit (and print them separately).
 - I recommend printing the model upside down – this will produce a comfortable top side (with the smooth texture of your print sheet) and a rougher/grippier bottom.
 - I used 0.2mm layer height (structural) settings in Prusa Slicer. Larger layer heights make the top of the print (the bottom of the wrist rest if you print upside down) rougher because of the slope.
 - Use supports under the alignment pins. Supports aren't needed in the holes.
 - 10-15% infill is sufficient.
 - Glue the pieces together when you're done printing.
